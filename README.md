# MediationData

**MediationData** is an R package for auditing, reconstructing, and documenting
mediation-analysis datasets from complex research codebases.

The package is designed for situations where:
- mediation models are implemented across many scripts (R, Rmd, Mplus, etc.),
- raw data availability is partial or uncertain,
- and reproducibility requires a clear, auditable record of what *can* and *cannot*
  be reconstructed from available files.

The package uses the OpenAI Responses API to assist with large-scale code inspection,
while keeping all decisions and results transparent to the user.

## 1. Exported functions

### `generate_mediation_repro_codes()`

This is the **main entry point** of the package.

It performs the following steps:

1. Scans a project directory to detect locally available raw data files.
2. Bundles all project code files into a single text-based PDF.
3. Uploads the PDF to the OpenAI API.
4. Prompts the model to:
   - detect mediation analyses,
   - assess reconstructibility given the available raw data,
   - generate R code for dataset reconstruction when possible,
   - generate R code defining a metadata tibble.
5. Writes the generated code to disk.
6. Validates whether the generated R code references data files that are *not*
   present locally and reports any mismatches.

**Function signature**

```r
generate_mediation_repro_codes(
  prompts,
  api_key,
  folder_dir,
  model = "gpt-4o-mini",
  temperature = 0,
  api_base = "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  recursive = TRUE,
  cleanup_uploaded_files = TRUE,
  output_data_code = "data_code.R",
  output_metadata_code = "metadata_code.R"
)
````

**Key return values**

The function returns (invisibly) a list containing:

* `detected_data_files` – raw data files found locally
* `data_code_path` – path to generated reconstruction code
* `metadata_code_path` – path to generated metadata code
* `referenced_data_files` – data files referenced by generated code
* `missing_referenced_data_files` – referenced files not found locally
* `validation_passed` – logical flag indicating whether all referenced files exist

---

### Other exported helpers

Depending on your installation, the package may also export utilities such as:

* `detect_raw_data_files()` – scan directories for candidate raw data files
* `write_code_files_pdf()` – bundle code into a PDF for upload

These are primarily intended for internal or advanced use.
Most users only need `generate_mediation_repro_codes()`.

## 2. Worked example

The script below is adapted from `try_package.R`.
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end run of the package.

```r
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Example: auditing a mediation study codebase
# ------------------------------------------------------------

library(MediationData)

# Directory containing the original mediation study code and data
input_dir <- "C:/Users/chen/Downloads/mediation_studies/2nb6x"

# Instruction prompt passed to the OpenAI model
# This defines the reconstruction rules and output format
my_instructions <- "
You are an expert in statistical programming (R, Python, Stata),
mediation analysis, data reconstruction, and code-base forensics.

Your tasks are to:
1. Detect all mediation analyses in the project.
2. Determine whether their datasets can be reconstructed from the raw data I possess.
3. Produce R code to reconstruct the mediation datasets when possible, or NULL when not.
4. Produce metadata describing all mediation models.
5. Produce R code to generate a metadata tibble.
"

# Run the main wrapper
res <- generate_mediation_repro_codes(
  prompts    = my_instructions,
  api_key    = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
  folder_dir = input_dir,
  model      = "gpt-4o-mini",
  temperature = 0
)

# Inspect validation results
res$validation_passed
res$missing_referenced_data_files
```

In this example, the package correctly identifies that the mediation dataset
used in the Mplus model cannot be reconstructed from the locally available raw data.

## 3. Example outputs

Below are example outputs generated by the package.

### 3.1 `data_code.R`

This file contains R code to reconstruct all datasets that *can* be reconstructed.
When a mediation dataset cannot be reconstructed, it is explicitly set to `NULL`
with detailed comments explaining why.

```r
# DATA_CODE

# ---- Packages ----
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# ---- Raw pilot data (only files available) ----
# The only raw files you have are the pilot CSVs, which are *not* used
# in the Mplus mediation model.

mba <- read.csv(here("Raw Data", "pilot_raw_data_mba_osf.csv"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ug  <- read.csv(here("Raw Data", "pilot_raw_data_undergrad_osf.csv"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

names(mba) <- tolower(names(mba))
names(ug)  <- tolower(names(ug))

# Clean MBA data
mba <- mba %>%
  select(q2_1:q1) %>%
  rename(gender = q1) %>%
  rename_all(.funs = ~ sub("q2_", "q", .x)) %>%
  mutate(
    population = "mba",
    gender = factor(gender,
                    levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                    labels = c("Male", "Female", "Other"))
  )

# Clean undergrad data
ug <- ug %>%
  select(gender = q180, q1:q8) %>%
  mutate(population = "undergrad")

# Combine pilot samples
pilot <- bind_rows(mba, ug) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender))

# Create pilot scales
pilot <- pilot %>%
  mutate(
    endorse = rowMeans(select(., c(q3, q4, q6, q7)), na.rm = TRUE),
    norm    = rowMeans(select(., c(q2, q5, q8)), na.rm = TRUE)
  )

m_pilot <- pilot

# ---- Mediation dataset (M1) ----
# Required raw file "Raw Data/full_mba_data.csv" is missing.
# Therefore, the mediation dataset cannot be reconstructed.

m1_data <- NULL
```

---

### 3.2 `metadata_code.R`

This file defines a tibble summarizing each mediation analysis,
including reconstructibility status and reasons when reconstruction fails.

```r
# METADATA_CODE

library(tibble)

mediation_metadata <- tibble(
  analysis_id = "M1",
  dataset_name = "m1_data",
  treatment_var = "gcdomt1, gcpret1",
  mediator_vars = "gcdeft2",
  outcome_var = "gcprdvt2",
  control_vars = paste(
    "gcprdvt1, gcsoct1, gccmpt1, gender, rtr_gend;",
    "clusters: target, rater"
  ),
  variable_descriptions = paste(
    "gcdomt1: dominance at T1;",
    "gcpret1: prestige at T1;",
    "gcdeft2: deference at T2;",
    "gcprdvt2: social rank at T2"
  ),
  reconstruction_status = "not possible",
  reason_if_not_reconstructible =
    "Raw MBA file 'Raw Data/full_mba_data.csv' is unavailable.",
  code_source_location =
    "Mplus mediation model and supporting Rmd scripts."
)
```

## Summary

This package is designed to make mediation-data reconstruction:

* explicit,
* auditable,
* and reproducible.

Even when reconstruction is *not* possible, the package produces
clear, machine-readable documentation explaining why.
