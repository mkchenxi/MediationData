\arguments{
\item{folder}{Character scalar. Directory containing code files.}

\item{output_pdf}{Character scalar. Path to output PDF file.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Whether to scan \code{folder} recursively.}

\item{exts}{Character vector. File extensions to include (without dot).}

\item{files}{Optional character vector of explicit file paths to include.}

\item{header_prefix}{Character scalar. Prefix shown before each file header.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, a list with \code{pdf} (path) and \code{files} (included paths).

\description{
Creates a monospaced, paginated PDF containing the contents of selected code files.
This avoids OCR (the PDF is text-based) and is suitable for APIs that accept PDFs
as input attachments.
